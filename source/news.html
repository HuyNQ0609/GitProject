<p>A black hole , or black hole , is a region of space-time where the gravitational field is so strong that nothing—no
  <br>matter particles or even electromagnetic radiation like light— can escape it. General relativity predicts that
  <br>a sufficiently large amount of matter in a small enough range will distort spacetime to become a black hole.
  <br>Around the black hole is a surface defined by a mathematical equation called the event horizon , at which when
  <br>matter passes it will not be able to escape out of the black hole. The black hole is called a "black" because it
  <br>absorbs all the radiation and matter that pulls across the event horizon, like an absolute black body in
  <br>thermodynamics ; it's also not some kind of "hole" or "hole" but a region of spacetime that doesn't let anything out.
  <br>Quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that at the event horizon a black hole will emit radiation just
  <br>as a black body of a certain temperature emits thermal radiation. This temperature is inversely proportional to the
  <br>mass of the black hole, making it very difficult to observe this radiation for black holes of medium or stellar mass.
